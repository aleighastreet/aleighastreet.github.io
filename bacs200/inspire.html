	Megan Rapinoe has been someone that I have always looked up to growing up. She inspires me and makes the world a little brighter.
    </p>
    <p> Megan Rapinoe inspires me because she stands up for equal pay rights for women soccer players. I believe she is an important leader in today's fight for equal pay rights, and I look up to her for making her voice heard. </p>
