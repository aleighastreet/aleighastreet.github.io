					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>Communicating through social media allows individuals to hide behind a profile and miss out on in-person communication skills. However, social media can allow users to meet many individuals virtually online that they wouldn't be able to meet in-person. </p>

					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p>Social Media has fueled the global economy by allowing a number of jobs to be created and for businesses to flourish by easily reaching their intended audience. Although Westminister Research says, "an increase in SM penetration has a negative and significant effect on economic growth. In particular, a 1% increase in the number of SM users contributes to a decrease in GDP growth of between 0.02% â€“ 0.06%."</p>

					<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p>Many people love looking at the world's current news through social media platforms as it is convenient and right at their fingertips. But, the interent is a place where users can provide false information and edit posts with misleading information.</p>

				<section id="conclusion">
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>Social media can be seen as both a positive and negative in our lives today. However, I believe there are many more benefits of social media. It is a convenient way of sharing tons of information to millions in any location. One day, I hope to be in social media marketing for a professional sports team, and sports marketing is becoming more prevalant to today's society and used in a team's everyday operations.</p>
