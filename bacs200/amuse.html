    <h2>Top Laugh</h2>
    <p>
       Just recently, my friends sent this video to me over Twitter, and it's something I've been sharing to others.

    <h2>Funny Tweet</h2>
    <p>
       This Tweet is funny to me because it reminds me of my high school's soccer team. They thought they were amazing, but they would always lose and not impress anyone.

    <h2>Relatable Tweet</h2>
    <p>
       I relate to this because March 13, 2020 was the day everything was changed and shut down. I still remember receiving all the emails about how school will be shut down for an unkown amount of time as I was boarding a plane for Hawaii for Spring Break surrounded by hundreds of other concerned people.
